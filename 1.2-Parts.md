### Resistors

A resistor is an electrical component that adds resistance, and dissipates electricity. 

[Symbol and Notation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor#Electronic_symbols_and_notation)

Resistance is shown as R, with the SI unit Ohms (Ω). Equivalent resistance is the total resistance measured across multiple resistors together.

Here is Ohm's Law:
$V = i * R$
Where V is the Voltage, i is the Current, and R is the resistance. 

Resistors behave differently when wired in series, and when wired parallelly. 

- Series:
    - Here, finding the Equivalent Resistance is simple, we add the resistance of the resistors together.
    - $R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n$

- Parallel:
    - Here, finding the Equivalent Resistance is a bit trickier, we take the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the resistors.
    - $R_{eq} = \frac{1}{(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n})}$

- Why is it needed? 
    - Resistors can help control current flow
    - They can help protect components this way
    - For example, on an arduino, we try to add a 220Ω resistor when using a small LED to decrease the 5V that the arduino provides to the Forward Voltage of the LED
- What is it?
    - It is an electronic component that slows down the flow of current
- How does it work?
    - A resistor is not a perfect conductor, so it restricts the flow of electricity
    - This lost electricity is dissipated as heat
- When is it used?
    - A simple use is to decrease the current flow, usually to protect components like LEDs
- Where is it used?
    - Resistors are a very common component - they are used almost everywhere you see a circuit
