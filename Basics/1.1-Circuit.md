# Electronic circuit

## What is an electrical circuit?
A circuit is a complete path that allows electricity to flow through. 

This may contain some electrical components like resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, etc. They are connected by traces, wires or something similar, usually made of a conductive material. 


- Why is it needed? 
    - This is needed for electricity to flow
- What is it? 
    - Basically we are taking a few components together and running electricity through them together 
- How does it work?
    - Usually, we have "sources" which provide electricity inside the circuits, along with components which store or dissipate electricity.
- When is it used? 
    - It is used anytime you need to power something. For example, to power a lightbulb, we connect it to an "AC" Circuit in our home.
- Where is it used?
    - Every small electrical/electronical system is made up of circuits. From the appliances in our homes to the computer/mobile you are reading this on.
