# Personal Notes - Basics of Electronics 
## Structure
I will try to give a short explanation, along with Why, what, how, when and wheres for each topic. I will also try to give a few links to learn more about the concept. 

I am just a student, documenting what I learn as I go. 

I will also attach a segment that explains these with a short answer, to understand it in a more practical way.
- Why is it needed? 
- What is it?
- How does it work?
- When is it used?
- Where is it used?
